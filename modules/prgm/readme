tracker/prgm 0.1.7 info

oscillators 1-4 are sent to outputs 1-4, note that 3 and 4 are direct out, watch out for high levels!

input parameters
osc_f           scaled pitch
osc_t           transposed pitch
(osc_ffamount	fine pitch attenuator)
osc_wf          waveform
sync_trig       sync trig
osc_trip        sync trip point
(osc_amp         amp)
cv_f            scaled cv
cv_t            transposed cv

note!
osc pitch = osc_f * osc_t
cv pitch = cv_f * cv_t
