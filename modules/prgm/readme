for just frequency and customs scales..

place these files in the directory Applications/SuperCollider; scale_custom.c, scale_custom.txt, scaler_note_custom.scd

edit the file scale_custom.c, compile it (gcc scale_custom.c) and run it (./a.out), it outputs a fresh 'scale_custom.txt'; you can change the size of the array and the number of octaves, just as long as the total number of values is 1024

open the file scaler_note_custom.scd in SuperCollider; don't forget to set the base frequency you want!

pick up the output file scaler_note_custom_val.dat from SC's current working directory, probably Applications/SuperCollider/

rename the .dat-file to scaler_note_12tet_val.dat and copy to the scalers/ directory on the sd-card

reboot bees and go!



tracker info..
oscillators 1-4 are sent to outputs 1-4, note that 3 and 4 are direct out, watch out for high levels!
