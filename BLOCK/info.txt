IO
CV in 1 takes signals in the range of 0-5V and samples them at 48k | 12bit. note: signals above 2.5V will show up as negative in this version.

samples are saved to a raw pcm16le format in the folder data/block/samples/

use this

./ffmpeg -f s16le -ar 48k -i sample.block sample.wav

to convert them to wav.
