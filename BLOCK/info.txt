IO
CV in 1 takes signals in the range of 0-5V and samples them at 48k | 12bit. sample time is fixed at 4 seconds.

note: signals above 2.5V will show up with a negative phase. pressing sw 3 will test for any values over 2.5V (2047), if found the highest captured value is returned, if not found the "headroom" to clip is returned. if the input is over 5V at any time during a recording, a highest captured value of 8190 will be returned.

samples are saved to a raw s16le format in the folder data/block/samples/

use this

./ffmpeg -f s16le -ar 48k -i sample.s16le sample.wav

to convert them to wav.
