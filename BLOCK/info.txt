IO
CV in 1 takes signals in the range of 0-5V and samples them at 48k | 12bit. sample time is fixed at 4 seconds.

note: pressing sw 3 will test for any values over 5V within a capture, if found a message "clip.." is returned, if not found the "headroom to clip" value is returned.

samples are saved to a raw s16le format in the folder data/block/samples/

use this

./ffmpeg -f s16le -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 48k -i sample.s16le sample.wav

to convert them to wav.
